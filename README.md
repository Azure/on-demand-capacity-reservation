**Welcome to the Private Preview program for On-demand capacity reservation! We are very excited to have you as a customer and look forward to receiving your feedback for this new feature.**

This preview is designed for our customers to test out the feature and try our APIs and provide any feedback. For now, private preview will only support limited VM SKU sizes for standalone VMs in South Central and West Central US regions. We will be adding support for Virtual Machine Scale Sets in the next few weeks as part of the private preview program. For the list of supported scenarios, please refer to the "On-Demand Capacity Reservation.docx". We will be updating the list of supported scenarios as needed.
